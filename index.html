    CHOCOLATE
</h2>
<p>
    Chocolate is derived from the fruit of the cacao tree, which grows exclusively in tropical climates. The cacao tree is native to Central and South America, but once European invaders discovered the delicacy in the 18th century.Historically, fine chocolate falls into three main categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams explained. Dark chocolate is made with chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla. Milk chocolate includes the same ingredients as dark chocolate plus milk fats and milk solids. White chocolate is made with the same ingredients as milk chocolate, except it does not include the chocolate liquor.

<h3>
    Advantages of Chocolate
</h3>
<p>
    These are just a few of the ways research has shown that dark chocolate can benefit you:

    Increases heart health: The antioxidants in dark chocolate have been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of clotting and increase blood circulation to the heart, thus lowering the risks of stroke, coronary heart disease and death from heart disease.

    Balances the immune system: Flavonols prevent the immune system from going into overdrive and reduce oxidative stress, which is an imbalance caused by cells fighting against free radicals and a common cause of many diseases.

    Combats diabetes: Epicatechin protects cells, makes them stronger and supports the processes that help the body to use insulin better, which might prevent or combat diabetes.

    Improves brain function: Flavonols in dark chocolate have a positive impact on brain function, including better reaction time, visual-spatial awareness and stronger memory. Though research is ongoing, one reason for this may be that flavonols increase blood flow to the brain.

    Boosts athletic performance: The epicatechin in dark chocolate increases the production of nitric oxide in the blood, which supports circulation and reduces the amount of oxygen an athlete uses while engaged in moderately intense exercise. This allows the athlete to maintain workout intensity for longer.

<h4>
    Disadvantages of Chocolate
</h4>
<p>
    High calorie content

    Chocolate is calorie-dense. A 1.55-ounce bar of milk chocolate contains 235 calories. This amount is more than many other snack foods provide. For example, a 1.55-ounce serving of beef jerky provides 124 calories. Consuming too many high-calorie foods can lead to obesity.

    Low in Vitamins and Minerals

    Chocolate can have a detrimental effect on your health if you eat it instead of a healthier snack, because of its few beneficial nutrients. Chocolate is not a significant source of vitamins, and provides just 8 percent of the daily-suggested intake of calcium and 2 percent of the daily-suggested intake of iron.
